# SparkAR-NativeUI-Slider-v85

⚠️ MAKE SURE THE NATIVEUI SLIDER IS ENABLED IN YOUR PROJECT CAPABILITIES ⚠️

This is meant to be a boilerplate for new users or non-scripters to start using Spark AR's NativeUI Slider fur their Instagram effects. The basic version takes into account the changes to Spark AR v85+ API and uses Promises to load assets. It is not meant to be a comprehensive exploration into ES6, Spark AR, or writing performant code. This is meant to educate and - hopefully - inspire others to continue learning about how to leverage scripting in their effects.

## What's Included
